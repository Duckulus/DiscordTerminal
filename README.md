Give it any name and select the Channel that you want your messages in.

Next you'll need to Configurate the Plugin. After loading the Plugin at least once, in your Server folder head to `plugins\DiscordTerminal\config.yml` and replace the dummy url with the url of your webhook.

**Now just restart your Server and everything should be working fine**
